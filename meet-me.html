                <p class="main-para text-white pt-lg-5 pt-4">Now that we had a viable user flow, we tasked ourselves
                    with creating a set of wireframes. As per our user flow, we have a Login, Activity Feed, Create
                    Activity and Activity Detail pages.</p>

                <p class="main-para mt-lg-5 mb-lg-4">Using these wireframes, we created a prototype for user testing.
                    When we tested this prototype with a group of users, we tasked them with figuring out how to create
                    a new activity.</p>
                <p class="main-para mb-lg-4">When the users attempted to do this, it was very well received. Most found
                    it easy to do and had no issues proceeding with the task. Some of the feedback we received was that
                    the activity page was too crowded and that they loved the idea that they could choose to either find
                    an existing activity or create their own.</p>

                <p class="main-para mt-lg-5 pt-lg-4 text-white">One of the things that I learned from this project that
                    I will
                    definitely carry through is the fact that there will always be differing opinions on how to tackle a
                    project. The important thing is to give stage to all parties and come to a consensus only after
                    hearing all viewpoints.</p>
                <p class="main-para mt-lg-2 text-white">I’ve also been grateful to have a better understanding of the
                    fact that you can’t make assumptions about your users. We went into this project with that, based on
                    the project brief, that this product would revolve around dating. However, through our user
                    interviews we learned that most people were interested in making a connection – not just a romantic
                    connection.</p>
