                        <p>When in a parkade, it can be very confusing to know how to get to your destination if there
                            are not clear markers that tell a person where to go. This means a person could either get
                            lost or arrive at a different destination than was intended.</p>
                        <p class="lastP">In addition to the parkade, we added the scope of a signage guideline for the
                            retail sector of the buildings. This allows for the building to set a set of rules for the
                            signage used for the retail units within the building.</p>

                    <p class="main-para text-white">1. User Centered Design thinking is key to effective products. This
                        framework really helped to structure the tasks at hand and allowed me to stay focused and on
                        track throughout the entire project.</p>
                    <p class="main-para text-white">2. First impressions. You only have one chance to make a first
                        impression. Putting the customer first is vital because people will only care about their
                        experiences. The simplicity of the app allows for the user to seamlessly flow thru the app from
                        start to finish.</p>
                    <p class="main-para text-white">3. Focus on the problem. At the end of the day, your user’s pains
                        are what you should be solving. So, these should be kept in the forefront as the project goes
                        on. Don’t lose sight of this when you’re in the trenches of the project.</p>
